  * Did not upgrade `docxtpl`
    *  Awaiting to see how the developer wants to proceed with [issue #114](https://github.com/elapouya/python-docx-template/issues/414)
    * Not upgrading from 0.12 to the latest 0.15.2 has no effect on Ghostwriter at this time
* Collapsed the `Domain` model's various categorization fields into a single `categorization` field with PostgreSQL's `JSONField` type

  * Categorization is no longer limited to specific vendors
  * Going forward, the field can be manually updated with valid JSON
  * Ghostwriter will look for JSON formatted as a series of keys and values: `{"COMPANY": "CATEGORY", "COMPANY": "CATEGORY",}`
* Converted the `ReportTemplate` model's `lint_result` field to a PostgreSQL `JSONField`
  * An important milestone/change for the upcoming GraphQL API
  * This change increases reliability and performance by removing any need to transform a string representation back into a `dict`
  * Little to no impact on users but templates may need to be linted again after the upgrade
  * If a template is affected, the status will change to "Unknown" with a single warning note: "Need to re-run linting following your Ghostwriter upgrade"

  * An important milestone/change for the upcoming GraphQL API
  * This change increases reliability and performance by removing any need to transform a string representation back into a `dict`
  * This field was always intended to be edited only by the server, so this change should not require any actions before or after upgrading
  * If an existing record's DNS data cannot be converted to JSON it will be cleared and user's can re-run the DNS update task
* Added a "sticky" sidebar tracker to user sessions so the sidebar will stay open or closed between visits and page changes
* Removed the legacy `health_dns` field from the `Domain` model
  * This field was part of the original Shepherd project and was an interesting experiment in using passive DNS monitoring to try to determine if a domain was "burned"
  * It became mostly irrelevant when services that supported this feature (e.g., eSentire's Cymon) were retired
* Changed some code that will be deprecated in future versions of Django v4.x and Python Faker
* Made it possible to sort the report template list
  * Sorting on this table is reversed so clicking "Status" once will sort templates with passing linter checks first
* Updated the admin panel to make it easier to manage domains for those who prefer the admin panel
* Projects now sort in reverse so the most recent projects appear first
* Updated the report selection section of the sidebar to make it easier to switch reports when working on multiple and navigate to your current report

* Removed the "Upload Evidence" button from editors where it does not apply (e.g., in the Finding Library outside of a report) (Fixes #185)
* Updated the Namecheap sync task to use paging so Namecheap libraries with more than 100 domains can be fully synced (Fixes #188)
* Dashboard once again has a "Project Assignments" card to make it easier to see and click projects
  * The calendar remains on the dashboard and is still clickable, but some people found it less intuitive as a shortcut
* Some general code clean-up for maintainability

* Fixed unauthenticated access to domain and server library exports
* Updated TinyMCE to v5.10.1 to address several moderate security issues with <5.10

* Added a custom "division by zero" error message for times when a Jinja2 template attempts to divide a value (e.g., total num of completed objectives) that is zero without first checking the value

## [2.2.1] - 2021-05-28

### Added

* Every page now includes a footer at the bottom of the content that displays the version number of the  Ghostwriter server.

### Fixed

* Findings with no assigned editors will no longer prevent report generation.

### Changed

* Findings in a report now have an `ordering` value that represents their position in the report \(starting at zero with the top finding in the most severe category\).
* Headings throughout the interface are no longer all caps by default \(this could negatively affect readability\).
* Some form elements will no longer appear far apart when the interface is fullscreen on a very high-resolution or wide-screen display.

## [2.2.0] - 2021-05-10

### Added

* Added new `filter_type` filter to report templates \(submitted by @5il with PR \#152\).
* Introduced the new `ReportData` serializer. This is nearly invisible to users but is a huge efficiency and performance upgrade for the back-end. Changes to project data models will now automatically appear in the raw JSON reports and be accessible within DOCX reports.
* The new serializer has modified some of the Jinja2 template expressions. View a JSON report to see everything available. For example, instead of writing `{{ project_codename }}`, you will access this project value with `{{ project.codename }}`.
* Ghostwriter now handles dates differently to better support all international date formats. Dates displayed in the interface and dates within reports \(e.g., `report_date`\) will match the date locale set in your server settings \(`en-us` by default\).

### Fixed

* Updated broken POC contact edit URL on the client details page
* Project assignment dates will no longer be improperly adjusted on updates
* Template linter context now has entries for new RichText objects
* Adjusted HTML parser to account for the possibility for empty fields following an update from one of the older versions of Ghostwriter  \(submitted by @Abstract-9 with PR \#158\)
* Adjusted Dockerfile files to fix potential filesystem issues with the latest Alpine Linux image \(submitted by @studebacon with PR \#143\).
* Added a missing field in the Report Template admin panel
* "Add to Report" on the finding details page now works
* Updated delete actions for operation logs to avoid anerror that could prevent the deletion of entries when deleting an entire log
* Domain age calculations are now accurate
* An invalid value for domain purchase date no longer causes a server error during validation
* Constrained `Twisted` library to v20.3.0 to fix a potential issue that could come up with Django Channels
  * [https://github.com/django/channels/issues/1639](https://github.com/django/channels/issues/1639)
* Improved the reporting engine to handle even the wildest nested styling

### Changed

* Adjusted finding severity lists to sort by the severity's weight instead of alphabetically.
* Re-enabled evidence uploads in all WYSIWYG editors \(it was previously excluded from certain finding fields\).
* Adjusted sidebar organization to improve visibility of a few sections that could be difficult to locate.
* Updated BootStrap and FontAwesome CSS versions.
* Updated all Python libraries to their latest versions.
* Animated the hamburger menus for fun.
* Switched ASGI servers \(from Daphne server to Uvicorn\) for WebSockets and better performance.
* Updated the sample _template.docx_ to act as a walkthrough for the new report data and changes in Jinja2 expressions.
