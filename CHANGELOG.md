  * Thank you, @domwhewell, for the original submission (Closes #397)
* Added template linting checks for the Heading 1-7 styles
  * These styles should always be present in a Word document but may be unidentifiable if _styles.xml_ is corrupted
* Added support for using Jinja2 in the report filename template configured under the _Global Report Configuration_ inside the admin panel
  * You can now use Jinja2 expressions to template the report filename (e.g., `{{client.name}}` or `{{now|format_datetime("Y-m-d")}}`)
  * The filename template is used when downloading a generated report
* Added options for importing and exporting observations
* Added support for Jinja2-style loops inside the WYSIWYG editor
  * You can now use Jinja2 loops to create lists, table rows, and new paragraphs
  * Use `li`, `tr`, and `p` tags with the loops–e.g., `{%li for item in items %}...{%li endfor %}`

### Changed

* The _Reports_ tab on the project dashboard has been renamed to _Reporting_ to better reflect the new project document templates
* Exports now include an `extra_fields` column for any user-defined extra fields associated with the exported data
* Slack messages for cloud assets now include the asset's current state (e.g., Running, Stopped, etc.) (Closes #417)
* The activity log filter now searches all log entries for the log, not just the entries on the current page
  * Log entries will continue to update in real time as new entries are added
  * Only the entries that match the filter will appear until the filter is changed or cleared
* Set a default value of `{}` for extra fields to avoid errors when creating new entries via the GraphQL API with empty extra fields
* Modified error handling for report generation to provide more detailed error messages when a report fails to generate (e.g., which finding or field caused the error)
* Changed nullable database fields to no longer be nullable to prevent errors when creating new entries via teh GraphQL API
* Removed the spaces before and after the figure and table prefixes to allow for flexibility (Closes #446)
  * If spaces before or after the prefix are desired, they can be added when setting the value in the report configuration
  * Current values should be updated to add spaces (if desired) – e.g., change "–" to " – "

  * Custom field types include text, integer, float, boolean, and formatted text
  * Custom fields can be added, edited, and deleted via the admin panel
  * Formatted text fields use the WYSIWYG editor for formatting
  * Formatting carries over to report templates like formatted text in findings
  * Custom fields are available in the report template context
  * Learn more: [https://ghostwriter.wiki/](https://ghostwriter.wiki/)
* Added support for using Jinja2 and report context data inside formatted text fields
  * You can reference `{{ client.name }}` to insert the client's name into a formatted text field
  * You can also use Jinja2 filters and functions to manipulate the data (e.g., `{{ client.name|upper }}` to make the client's name uppercase)
* Added the ability to preview formatted text fields in the interface
  * Formatted text fields can be previewed with the new "Preview" button that appears next to them in the interface
  * Any evidence referenced in the formatted text field will also be displayed in the preview (rather than just the reference text)
  * Jinja2 statements and expressions will appear as text in the preview as these must be evaluated in the report template 
* Added support for tables in the WYSIWYG editor (Closes #355)
  * Tables use the _Table Grid_ style in the Microsoft Word templates 
  * Thank you for the contribution, [@domwhewell](https://github.com/domwhewell)!
* Added support for inserting page breaks in the WYSIWYG editor
  * Page breaks carry over to the Microsoft Word templates
* Added an option to "sanitize" activity logs as an alternative to deleting them to remove sensitive information
  * Sanitizing an activity log will remove selected data from all log entries in the log
* Added a new library for "observations"
  * These observations are similar to findings but much simpler
  * The base model includes a title, description, and tags and can be used to track positive observations for a project
  * The model is also highly customizable with support for custom fields (see the first item)
* Added user permissions to control who can create, edit, and delete observations in the library
* Added support for footer information (e.g., date, footer text, and slide numbers) in the PowerPoint report templates
  * The footer information is set in your slide deck templates
* Added a configuration option for the target report delivery date
  * The target date is configured as a number of business days from the project's end date
* Added a report configuration option to enforce title case for captions
  * If enabled, this option will enforce title case for all evidence captions in a report
  * An accompanying exclusion list allows you to specify words (e.g., articles) that should not be title cased
* Added a `getExtraFieldSpec` query to the GraphQL API that returns the extra field specification for a model
  * This query is useful for extensions that need to know the extra fields available for a model
* Added a note to the WYSIWYG editor to call-out it is possible to access a browser's context menu by using CTRL+right-click
* Added a new `hostname` configuration option to the General Settings in the admin panel
  * This option allows you to set the hostname for the Ghostwriter server
  * The hostname is used to generate links in Slack notifications and other places where a link to the server is needed

### Changed

* The WYSIWYG editor's toolbar and context menu have been updated to support the new table and page break features and make it easier to apply styles
* Project and report dashboards were redesigned to improve the layout and support the new custom fields
* Report dashboards now display the global report configuration for easier reference
* Added tags to the lists of findings, domains, and servers
* Uploaded evidence files can now be linked to a report rather than a finding
  * This change allows evidence files to be used in multiple findings, and the new custom formatted text fields
* When viewing an evidence file, the file contents are now displayed in the interface as they will appear in the report
  * This change allows you to preview the evidence file's contents with your border and caption before adding it to a report
  * Border width + color and figure label come from the global report configuration in the admin panel
* PowerPoint slide decks now include "Assessment Timeline" and "Observations" slides
  * The "Assessment Timeline" slide includes a table pre-populated with the project's start date, end date, and target report delivery date
  * The "Observations" slide(s) are similar to the findings slides but for the new observations 
* Reworked the reporting engine to reduce complexity and pave the way for future enhancements
  * This is mentioned here primarily for developers and integrators who may be working with the reporting engine
* Clicking the toast notification after adding a finding to a report will now take you to the report's findings tab
* Default values for extra fields are now set when creating a new entry with empty extra fields 
  * Default values now appear in the edit forms for the entries
  * The default value must be set before creating the entry for it to appear in the form or be set as the default value
* Updated the pre-built Ghostwriter CLI binaries to v0.2.19

### Deprecated

* The old "dot" variables used in findings (e.g., `{{.project_start}}` or `{{.client}}`) are no longer necessary and will be removed in a future release
  * The "dot" variables inserted some data previously unavailable while writing a finding inside Ghostwriter
  * The new support for Jinja2 composition inside the WYSIWYG editor makes these old "dot" variables redundant
  * The "dot" variables will still work in this release but are no longer referenced in the documentation
  * This deprecation does not include `{{.ref }}` or `{{.caption }}` which will continue to be used for captioning and creating cross-references references

  * The field is an open-ended text field that you can use to track a job ID, UUID, or other identifier for the entry
  * The field has no unique constraints at this time, so you can use it to track multiple entries with the same identifier
  * Logging extensions like the `cobalt_sync` project use this field to avoid duplicate entries when re-syncing
  * The field is hidden by default in the Ghostwriter web UI when viewing log entries

### Fixed

  * This allows accounts with the `user` role to edit project components without permission to edit the project or its assignments
* Moved project assignments to the new "People" tab on the project dashboard
* Hid menus and buttons for features that are not available to the current user
* Access to the admin console is now routed through the main login form to require 2FA (if enabled for the user)
* The CVSS Vector and "added as blank" fields on report findings are now optional as they were meant to be

### Removed

## [3.2.9] - 13 June 2023

### Added

* Added CVSS and tags to the finding rows in the Excel workbook report (xlsx)

## [2.2.1] - 2021-05-28

### Added

* Every page now includes a footer at the bottom of the content that displays the version number of the  Ghostwriter server.

### Fixed

* Findings with no assigned editors will no longer prevent report generation.

### Changed

* Findings in a report now have an `ordering` value that represents their position in the report \(starting at zero with the top finding in the most severe category\).
* Headings throughout the interface are no longer all caps by default \(this could negatively affect readability\).
* Some form elements will no longer appear far apart when the interface is fullscreen on a very high-resolution or wide-screen display.

## [2.2.0] - 2021-05-10

### Added

* Added new `filter_type` filter to report templates \(submitted by @5il with PR \#152\).
* Introduced the new `ReportData` serializer. This is nearly invisible to users but is a huge efficiency and performance upgrade for the back-end. Changes to project data models will now automatically appear in the raw JSON reports and be accessible within DOCX reports.
* The new serializer has modified some Jinja2 template expressions. View a JSON report to see everything available. For example, instead of writing `{{ project_codename }}`, you will access this project value with `{{ project.codename }}`.
* Ghostwriter now handles dates differently to better support all international date formats. Dates displayed in the interface and dates within reports \(e.g., `report_date`\) will match the date locale set in your server settings \(`en-us` by default\).

### Fixed

* Updated broken POC contact edit URL on the client details page
* Project assignment dates will no longer be improperly adjusted on updates
* Template linter context now has entries for new RichText objects
* Adjusted HTML parser to account for the possibility for empty fields following an update from one of the older versions of Ghostwriter  \(submitted by @Abstract-9 with PR \#158\)

* Added a missing field in the Report Template admin panel
* "Add to Report" on the finding details page now works
* Updated delete actions for operation logs to avoid an error that could prevent the deletion of entries when deleting an entire log
* Domain age calculations are now accurate
* An invalid value for domain purchase date no longer causes a server error during validation
* Constrained `Twisted` library to v20.3.0 to fix a potential issue that could come up with Django Channels
  * [https://github.com/django/channels/issues/1639](https://github.com/django/channels/issues/1639)
* Improved the reporting engine to handle even the wildest nested styling

### Changed

* Adjusted finding severity lists to sort by the severity's weight instead of alphabetically.
* Re-enabled evidence uploads in all WYSIWYG editors \(it was previously excluded from certain finding fields\).
* Adjusted sidebar organization to improve visibility of a few sections that could be difficult to locate.
* Updated BootStrap and FontAwesome CSS versions.
* Updated all Python libraries to their latest versions.
* Animated the hamburger menus for fun.
* Switched ASGI servers \(from Daphne server to Uvicorn\) for WebSockets and better performance.
* Updated the sample _template.docx_ to act as a walkthrough for the new report data and changes in Jinja2 expressions.
