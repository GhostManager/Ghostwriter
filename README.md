Ghostwriter is a Django-based web application designed to be used by an individual or a team of red team operators. The platform tracks and manages client and project information, covert infrastructure assets (e.g., servers and domain names), finding templates, report templates, evidence files, and more.

This data is available to Ghostwriter's reporting engine, which generates complete Word (DOCX) reports using Jinja2 templating and your customized report templates. Ghostwriter can also produce reports in XLSX, PPTX, and JSON formats.

Tap into Ghostwriter's GraphQL API to integrate custom project management, reporting workflows, and external tools into Ghostwriter.
