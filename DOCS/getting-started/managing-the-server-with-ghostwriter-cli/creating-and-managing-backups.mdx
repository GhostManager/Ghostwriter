Using Ghostwriter CLI to create and manage backups

## Creating and Managing Backups

Ghostwriter CLI (>=v0.2.12) includes `backup` and `restore` commands to help you create and manage backups of your PostgreSQL database.

The `backup` command uses PostgreSQL's `pg_dump` to dump the contents of the database. The resulting SQL file is gunzipped and stored in the `production_postgres_data_backups` Docker volume. Each file is named with the current timestamp (e.g., *backup\_2023\_05\_23T15\_54\_19.sql.gz*).

Use the `--list` flag to list all available backup files stored in the volume.

The `restore` command recreates the database using the specified backup file.
