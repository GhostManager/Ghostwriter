How to check for updates and what to do when one is available

## Checking for Updates

You can check for updates with Ghostwriter CLI and the `update` command. The output will look something like this:

```bash Checking for Updates
$ ./ghostwriter-cli update

Local Ghostwriter Version	Ghostwriter v3.0.5 ( 23 September 2022 )
Latest Stable Release		Ghostwriter v3.0.5 ( 23 September 2022 )
```

The command will take a moment to run as Ghostwriter CLI requests the latest release number from GitHub. The latest version number will not be displayed if you do not have a network connection.

If your version number and release date are older than the reported latest release, you may want to update. Check the [Ghostwriter CHANGELOG](https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see what has changed to determine if now is the right time to update for you.

## Installing Updates

Updating Ghostwriter is as easy as pulling the latest code and building the updated containers. Your data will be unaffected by the build process.

<Note>
Updates are generally straightforward, but you should **strongly** consider taking a snapshot of your host server if anything goes wrong. There is always a chance something like a Python library may not install correctly, and you don't have the time to address it on the spot. You will thank yourself if you can restore a snapshot and try again later.
</Note>

To perform an update:

```log Updating Ghostwriter
git pull
./ghostwriter-cli containers down
./ghostwriter-cli containers build
./ghostwriter-cli containers up
```

These commands pull the latest code, stop any running production containers, build the new containers, and then bring Ghostwriter back online.
