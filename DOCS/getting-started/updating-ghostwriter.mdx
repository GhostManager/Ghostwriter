How to check for updates and what to do when one is available

## Checking for Updates

You can check for updates with Ghostwriter CLI and the `version` command. The output will look something like this:

```bash Checking for Updates
$ ./ghostwriter-cli version
[+] Fetching latest version information:
[+] Checking the status of Docker and the Compose plugin...

Ghostwriter CLI
Local Version	v0.1.0
Latest Release	v0.3.0

Ghostwriter
Local Version	v6.2.3
Latest Release	v6.2.3

Download the latest version of Ghostwriter CLI at:	https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter_CLI/releases/tag/v0.3.0
```

The command will take a moment to run as Ghostwriter CLI requests the latest release number from GitHub. The latest version number will not be displayed if you do not have a network connection.

If your version number and release date are older than the reported latest release, you may want to update. Check the [Ghostwriter CHANGELOG](https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see what has changed to determine if now is the right time to update for you.

## Installing Updates

Updating Ghostwriter is as easy as running the `update` command to pull the latest published images.

<Note>
Updates are generally straightforward, but you should **strongly** consider taking a snapshot of your host server if anything goes wrong. There is always a chance something like a Python library may not install correctly, and you don't have the time to address it on the spot. You will thank yourself if you can restore a snapshot and try again later.
</Note>

To perform an update:

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash Linux
    ./ghostwriter-cli update
    ```

    ```powershell Windows PowerShell
    .\ghostwriter-cli update
    ```

    ```bash Mac
    ./ghostwriter-cli update
    ```
</CodeGroup>

The `update` command pulls the latest published images. You can also use the `--version` tag to specify a version.

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash Linux
    ./ghostwriter-cli update --version v6.2.3
    ```

    ```powershell Windows PowerShell
    .\ghostwriter-cli update --version v6.2.3
    ```

    ```bash Mac
    ./ghostwriter-cli update --version v6.2.3
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  The `--version` flag does not support _downgrading_ your version.
