## Using Ghostwriter CLI to Manage the Server

Ghostwriter CLI can handle just about anything you might need or want to do with your Ghostwriter installation. Running the tool with the `help` command–or no command–will print the latest usage information.

The following sections explain some of the core functionality.

<Info>
By default, all commands target a production environment. Provide the `--dev` if you're interacting with a development environment. Every command can accept the `--dev` flag.
</Info>

### Managing the Server Configuration

The `config` command is your Swiss Army knife when managing your server configuration. If you don't provide any subcommands or arguments, the command prints your current configuration values (the contents of your server's DotEnv file).

You can pull and set configuration values with `config`. Use `config get` to fetch a specific value or set of values. Use `config set` to change a value.

There are also several subcommands to help you manage hostnames and origins you trust: `allowhost`, `disallowhost`, `trustorigin`, and `distrustorigin`. Use these subcommands to adjust those values, as the Quick Start guide describes.

### Managing Docker Containers

Ghostwriter CLI's `containers` command contains the following subcommands:

* `build` : Rebuild the containers (not the data volumes)

* `up` : Bring up Ghostwriter containers

* `down` : Bring down Ghostwriter containers

* `start`: Start all stopped services and restart any running services

* `stop`: Stop all running services

* `restart` : Stop and restart all services


If you need to check which containers are running, issue the `running` command. This command lists all running containers related to Ghostwriter. The output will look something like this (edited for easier display):

```log Running Containers
$ ./ghostwriter-cli running
[+] Collecting list of running Ghostwriter containers...
[+] Found 4 running Ghostwriter containers

 Name                   Container ID    Image                           Status                  Ports
 ––––––––––––           ––––––––––––    ––––––––––––                    ––––––––––––            ––––––––––––

 ghostwriter_postgres   9992....        ghostwriter_production_postgres Up 43 hours (healthy)   0.0.0.0:5432:5432 » 5432/tcp
```

<Check>
The `Status` column shows the uptime and health of the service. If you see an `unhealthy` status that the service failed a health check and may not work properly. Learn more about health checks here: [Health Monitoring](/features/health-monitoring)
</Check>
You can use the `logs` command to view a particular container's recent log events. The command requires the name of a running container. Valid container names are:

* all
* django
* graphql
* nginx
* postgres
* redis

With `all`, logs from all running containers will be returned. By default, `logs` will return up to 500 lines. You can use the `--lines` flag to adjust how many lines you want to retrieve.

```log Viewing Django Logs
$ ./ghostwriter-cli logs django
