Templates can be added to the library one at a time or loaded en masse from a csv file.

<Tab title="Add One FindingUpload Findings">
To add just one finding to the library, click the **Findings Library** tab on the menu bar and **Add New Finding**. This opens the finding form for documenting and submitting a single finding template.

The **Finding Guidance** field is not used in reports. Use this field to explain how a finding should be used or what evidence should be included. The field can be left blank if you do not have anything for the finding.

<Tab title="Upload Findings">
To bulk add templates to the library, click the **Findings Library** tab on the menu bar and **Upload Bulk Findings**. This opens the upload form for your csv file. The csv file must have these headers:

_title, description, severity, impact, mitigation, replication\_steps, host\_detection\_techniques, network\_detection\_techniques, references, finding\_type, finding_guidance_

The _finding_guidance_ field is not used in reports. Use this field to explain how a finding should be used or what evidence should be included. The field can be left blank if you do not have anything for the finding.

<Info>
If a finding (based on the _title_ field) already exists in the library, the import will update the existing record instead of discarding the data or duplicating the entry.
