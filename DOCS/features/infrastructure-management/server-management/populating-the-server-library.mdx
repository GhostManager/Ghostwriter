## Adding Servers

Servers can be added to the library one at a time or loaded en masse from a csv file.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Add One Server">
To add just one server to the library, click the **Servers** tab on the menu bar and **Add New Server**. This opens the server form for documenting and submitting a single server.

<Tab title="Upload Servers">
To bulk add servers to the library, visit the admin panel and navigate to the **Static Servers** model. Click the **Import** button and follow the on-screen instructions.

You can upload csv, xls, xlsx, tsv, json, and yaml files. Select the matching format from the dropdown menu.

After a moment, the admin panel will display a diff screen and ask you to approve the changes.

<Check>
If a server exists in the library, the import will update the existing record instead of discarding the data or duplicating the entry.

### Add Server Providers

The infrastructure manager is seeded with a handful of popular server providers:

* Linode

* Rackspace

* Digital Ocean

* Microsoft Azure

* Amazon Web Services

* Google Compute Engine


If your server provider is not pre-populated, new providers can be added via the Django admin panel, `/admin/shepherd/serverprovider/`.
