## The Domain Library


The domain library lives at `/shepherd/domains/`. The library is where users can view the current status of each domain and check out a domain for a project.

## Adding Domains


Domains can be added to the library one at a time or loaded en masse from a csv file.

<Tab title="Add One Domain">
To add just one domain name to the library, click the **Domain Library** tab on the menu bar and **Add New Domain**. This opens the domain form for documenting and submitting a single domain name.

You may not know the latest health information for the domain. You can set the domain to **Healthy** as a default value and leave categories blank.

<Tab title="Upload Domains">
To bulk add servers to the library, visit the admin panel and navigate to the **Domains** model. Click the **Import** button and follow the on-screen instructions.

You can upload csv, xls, xlsx, tsv, json, and yaml files. Select the matching format from the dropdown menu.

After a moment, the admin panel will display a diff screen and ask you to approve the changes.

<Info>
If a domain name already exists in the library, the import will update the existing record instead of discarding the data or duplicating the entry.
</Info>
<Check>
The DomainCheck tool outputs a csv in this format if you want to preload health statuses with your domains. You may then optionally add the `note` column.
