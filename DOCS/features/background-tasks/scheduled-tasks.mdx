## Scheduling a Task

Tasks are scheduled in the Django admin panel under _Django Q_ and _Scheduled Tasks_. Add a new task, give the task a name, and tell it which function to run. Functions must be prefixed with `tasks.` to tell Django Q to pull the functions from `tasks.py`. The final requirement is a schedule. Tasks can be run once or repeatedly (e.g. minutes, hourly, daily, weekly).

<Info>
To schedule the `release_servers()` function inside `tasks.py`, you would enter the function name as: `tasks.release_servers`
</Info>
You can provide arguments for the functions as needed. Ghostwriter's scheduled tasks do not require arguments, but some have optional arguments. For example, the `scan_servers()` function accepts an `active_only` argument to restrict scanning only to servers that have been checked out for a project.

### Example Scheduled Task

Visit the Django Q database from the admin panel to access the _Scheduled Tasks_. You may wish to create a scheduled task to automatically release domains at the end of a project. There is a task for this already in `tasks.py`, `ghostwriter.shepherd.tasks.release_domains`.

This example executes `ghostwriter.shepherd.tasks.release_domains` under the name `Domain Release` every day at 15:39 UTC with no additional args or kwargs.
