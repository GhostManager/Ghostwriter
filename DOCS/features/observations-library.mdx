title: "Observations Library"
---

Observations work like slimmed-down findings: they are items that can be added to a report and have their own library, but don't have as many built-in fields. They can be used to report other aspects about the system being tested; for example, things that the system does well.

The library lives under `/reporting/observations/`. As with findings, observations created in the library are available to all users, and is intended to be a "single source of truth".

<Note>
As with findings, editing an observation in the library will also change it on all reports its attached to. If you need to edit the item for a single report, edit the attached observation from the report instead.
