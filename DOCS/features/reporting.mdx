Managing and using reporting options in Ghostwriter

Ghostwriter manages all data related to clients, projects, infrastructure, and findings/observations. There is a tremendous amount of reporting potential for historical data and end of project work (e.g. client-facing reports). That means *reporting* is not limited to just rendering a report of findings from a project.

More built-in statistics will come soon, but you can run reports using Django or a task in `tasks.py` (see [Background Tasks](/features/background-tasks)).
