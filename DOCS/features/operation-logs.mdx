Using the Operation Logs

The Ghostwriter operation logs are a place to view and edit all commands that have been executed for a particular project. With a simple table view, an operator or project manager can quickly review any action taken in a target network and supplement them with additional data. Commands can be imported and exported for use in external reporting tools.
