Ghostwriter v4+ supports the use of time-based, one-time passwords (TOTP) for two-factor authentication.

To enroll a device, visit your account profile and click the new _Set Up MFA_ button. Ghostwriter will provide you with a QR code to scan with 1Password, Google Authenticator, or any other TOTP app you prefer. The setup page also provides a secret if you want to configure an app manually.

Administrators can configure accounts to require MFA before the user can access Ghostwriter. Requiring MFA is configurable on a per-user basis. With this option enabled, accounts without a valid TOTP device can only log in, log out, change their password, and access the MFA setup page.

Ghostwriterâ€™s MFA also supports backup codes. You can generate and retrieve your backup codes from your profile page at any time after configuring MFA.
