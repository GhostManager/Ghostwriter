You will be prompted to enter a name and select the project to which this log belongs. While the name doesn't need to be unique to Ghostwriter, it does need to be unique to the project.

Click _Submit_ when you are done, and you will be taken to the log summary page.

On the log summary page, click the link for the new log, and you will be taken to the log entries table. This is where the user can view, create, modify, and delete entries.
