## Introducing the Report Types


Ghostwriter supports a variety of report types:

* Raw JSON

* Microsoft Office 2019 / 365

    * Word (docx)

    * Excel (xlsx)

    * PowerPoint (pptx)



### Selecting a Report Type

### JSON

The JSON output is the foundation of every other report type. It is surfaced as a report type to enable users to take it and create custom reports and visualizations.

Example Report JSON

```json ExampleJSONReport.json

### Office Documents

Microsoft Office is ubiquitous and a staple of many reporting workflows. To that end, Ghostwriter's reporting engine supports the construction and export of all three major Office file types: Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint slide decks.

You can customize each of these, so the exported files fit your specific needs.

#### Word Documents

For Word, Ghostwriter renders a _docx_ file using the JSON data and a report template. Review the Word section for more information on customization options and how to get started generating Word documents.
