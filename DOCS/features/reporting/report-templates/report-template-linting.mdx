## Introduction to the Report Template Linter

Ghostwriter automatically lints report templates when:

* The template is first created

* The template file changes

* The template's **Doc Type** value changes


You can also request the template to be linted at any time by viewing the template's details and selecting **Lint** from the options menu.

## Template Statuses

There are four possible linter results:

* **Success** – The template is ready to be used

* **Warning** – The template passed basic linting checks but might not give you the results you want

* **Failed** – The template failed the basic linting checks and cannot be used for report generation

* **Error** – Essentially the same as _Failed_ but means the linter encountered an error and could not complete linting


### Linting Checks

The linter checks several basic things to make sure the template is usable and then checks a few custom things:

1.  \[All\] Template file exists on the file system

2.  \[All\] File type matches the selected **Doc Type** value

3.  \[All\] File can be opened as the selected **Doc Type** value

4.  \[PowerPoint Only\] Template contains zero slides

5.  \[Word Only\] All Jinja2 expressions, statements, and filters are recognized

6.  \[Word Only\] Report engine can successfully render a document using the template

7.  \[Word Only\] Template contains the [recommended styles](/features/reporting/report-templates/word-template-styles)


Any issues related to the first three checks or a test report generation will result in a **Failed** status. The rest of the checks will generate warnings.

#### Reviewing Your Template's Styles

If you'd like to check a Word template's available styles before uploading, open the template in Word and follow these steps:

1.  Under the ribbon's _Home_ tab, go to the styles gallery and locate the _Styles Pane_ button

2.  Click the button to open the pane and view the list of _Recommended_ (default) styles

3.  Look at the bottom of the pane to find the _List_ filter dropdown box

4.  Click the dropdown and select _In current document_


The list of styles in a new document is far more limited than what you see in the style gallery or style pane.
