## Ghostwriter's Styles

You can configure many variables for a style in a Word document. In some cases, Ghostwriter must apply styles for you (ex: formatting text evidence in a finding). You can refine these styles by creating and editing these styles in your templates.

### Customizing the Styles

These styles are called by name:

| **Style Name**    | **Description**                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CodeBlock`       | Style text evidence and anything in the WYSIWYG editor's code editor (must be a *Paragraph* style type).                       |
| `CodeInline`      | Style runs of text formatted as code in the WYSIWYG editor (must be a *Character* style type).                                 |
| `Number List`     | Style numbered (ordered) lists.                                                                                               |
| `Bullet List`     | Style bulleted (unordered) lists.                                                                                             |
| `Caption`         | Built-in style used for captions below evidence and lines preceded by the *`{{.caption}}`* expression.                        |
| `List Paragraph`  | Built-in base style used for bulleted and numbered lists; the fallback built-in style if your template lacks customized styles. |
| `BlockQuote`      | Style used for block quotes.                                                                                                  |
| `Table Grid`      | Built-in style used for tables.                                                                                               |

**Note on List Styles**

You can choose not to create these list styles, but lists will probably not look right in your document. Word's built-in styles (e.g., *List Paragraph*) do not apply the proper/expected indentation. This leads to problems during later editing.

When you create a list in Word, the application applies *List Paragraph* and additional styling depending on your selection (numbered or bulleted). The style will appear as *List Paragraph,DAI2* or similar.

This style **does not exist** in your template until you use it once, so Ghostwriter can't default to using it. (See below.)

Create a numbered list, open the styles tab, and save the style as a new style named *Numbered List*. Repeat this for bulleted lists.

Feel free to modify the indentation for nested list items and any other style variables before you save your new style.

**Note on Built-in Styles**

Word offers many, many built-in styles you might expect to be available to Ghostwriter; however, these styles only exist in the Word *application*. Word will only add a style to your template's styles.xml when you use it to keep file size down.

This means a style like *Caption* will not exist in your template until you've applied it or created it yourself.

To add one of the built-in styles to your template, apply it once and save your document. You can undo the style. The important thing is the style appears under the *In current document* list in the Styles Pane.
