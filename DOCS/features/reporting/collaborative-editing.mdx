Ghostwriter uses an editor known as Tiptap to offer full collaborative editing for findings, project fields, and report fields.

You’ve probably edited a Google Doc. In fact, you’ve probably edited a Google Doc at the same time as other people and enjoyed how
you could see their edits appear on your screen in real-time. That is collaborative editing, and it’s a handy feature—not just
because you can see what others are doing but also because you don’t have to worry about the changes you make overwriting anyone
else when you save.

Because Ghostwriter is an open-source project that manages sensitive data that shouldn’t be sent to untrusted parties, we needed a
solution to maintain the infrastructure that was compatible with open-source, which ruled out many cloud-provided solutions. We
wanted a solution that allowed us to extend it with custom elements for features such as embedding evidence. We also needed a
solution that still allowed us to access the data on the server—not just in the web browser—so that Ghostwriter could still generate
reports. And finally, we wanted something that is actively maintained and has an active userbase to ensure continued support.

After searching, we concluded that the YJS ecosystem was the most mature for collaborative editing. YJS itself is a data format designed
for the task—it tracks a log of operations so each peer can make its edits and publish updates to the document to other peers.
The updates can be applied in any order, resulting in everyone having the same data after all of them are applied.

Many text editors supporting YJS exist. We selected the Tiptap rich text editor due to its features, maturity, and extensibility with
custom elements and formatting.

We selected Tiptap’s Hocuspocus server for sharing collaborative edits between peers. This server exposes a WebSocket endpoint that
the client publishes and receives updates on in real-time. It also handles loading and saving the YJS documents from a data store.

The end result is a fully collaborstive editing solution that is entirely self-contained within Ghostwriter. No use of cloud services and
completely open-source.
