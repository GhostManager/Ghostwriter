## Getting Started with PowerPoint

Ghostwriter uses template documents and the Jinja2 template language ([https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/)) to give you as much control over document generation as possible.

[Report Templates](/features/reporting/report-templates)

You will need to upload at least one PowerPoint slide deck to use as a template. Once you have a template you can pick from, open your report and select the template from the dropdown menu under the **Generate Reports** section. You should see a notification when the template selection is saved. You can then click the PowerPoint icon to generate a report.

Depending on the size of your report and template, rendering can take a few seconds. Once the report is done, your browser will download a new PowerPoint document.

The default filename will be: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_CLIENT-NAME_ASESSMENT-TYPE.pptx`

### PowerPoint Templates

There are fewer customization options for PowerPoint than Word. Your template slide deck controls how the generated slide deck looks, but the content will always be the same.

<Warning>
The PowerPoint template should be empty – i.e., should contain zero slides. Edit the master slides to control colors, layout, slide numbers, and other details.

To open your slide master view in PowerPoint: *View* » *Slide Master*
</Warning>
Ghostwriter will add slides to your chosen template slide deck. The new slides include placeholders and dynamic project information.

<Info>
Each slide is set to fit text to the size of the text field. This auto-resizing happens in PowerPoint's rendering engine, so a slide's text might extend beyond the slide's lower boundary when you open your new presentation.

PowerPoint should activate auto-resizing when you save the presentation or edit any text.
