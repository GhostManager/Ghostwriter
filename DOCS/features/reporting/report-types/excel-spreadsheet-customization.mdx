## Getting Started with Excel

No configuration is needed to generate a spreadsheet of report details. Open you report, scroll down to the **Generate Reports** section. and click the Excel icon to generate a spreadsheet.

Depending on the size of your report, rendering can take a few seconds. Once the report is done, your browser will download a new Excel document.

The default filename will be: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_CLIENT-NAME_ASESSMENT-TYPE.xlsx`

### Spreadsheet Contents

The spreadsheet's current version contains all the findings attached to your report. The first worksheet will contain a formatted table of your findings sorted by severity. The severity column will be color-coded with your configured severity colors.

It is impossible to insert evidence files into the spreadsheet cleanly, so it has an **Evidence** column. Ghostwriter replaces any references to evidence files with an entry in the **Evidence** column, so readers know there is additional evidence available for review.
