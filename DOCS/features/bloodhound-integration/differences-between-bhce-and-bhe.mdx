Ghostwriter integrates with both BHCE and BHE to pull domain data from your server. The full set of information will vary based on the environment,
but the data includes these items (and more) for each domain:

* Domain name
* User information — count, count of users with old passwords
* Computer information — count, operating systems
* Inbound and outbound trusts
* Functional level
* BloodHound's data quality assessment with totals for:
  * Organizational Units
  * Access Control Lists
  * Group Policy Objects
  * and more

BHE's API offers a "findings" endpoint that is unavailable in BHCE. If the configured instance is a BHE instance, Ghostwriter will
also collect the findings and make them available to reports.

## Viewing the BloodHound Data

An overview of the BloodHound data is available under your Project dashboard. If you have a global server or project server configured,
you will see the _BloodHound_ tab on the dashboard. This tab will show you the configured server's URL and has buttons for testing the
connection and fetching the latest data.

Once Ghostwriter has data, you will see one or more expandable sections. The _Domains_ section shows an overview of the collected domains
data. If the configured server is a BHE server, you will also see a _Findings_ section with an overview of the BHE findings.
