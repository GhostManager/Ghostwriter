Ghostwriter integrates with both BHCE and BHE to pull domain data from your server. The full set of information will vary based on the environment,
but the data includes these items (and more) for each domain:

* Domain name
* User information — count, count of users with old passwords
* Computer information — count, operating systems
* Inbound and outbound trusts
* Functional level
* BloodHound's data quality assessment with totals for:
  * Organizational Units
  * Access Control Lists
  * Group Policy Objects
  * and more

BHE's API offers a "findings" endpoint that is unavailable in BHCE. If the configured instance is a BHE instance, Ghostwriter will
also collect the findings and make them available to reports.
