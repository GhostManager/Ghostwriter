Ghostwriter integrates with BloodHound to pull data from the BloodHound graph and makes it available in your report
templates. If the BloodHound API is enabled and configured, Ghostwriter pulls the BloodHound data when you generate a
report.

Ghostwriter integrates with *both* BloodHound COmmunity Edition and BloodHound Enterprise. There are some differences
between the two. You can learn more here: [Differences Between BHCE and BHE](/features/bloodhound-integration/differences-between-bhce-and-bhe)

To enable the BloodHound API, generate your access token, and configure the API in Ghostwriter, follow these steps:

##  Generating an Access Token

Generate your BloodHound access token by logging into your BloodHound instance and opening the _Administration_ section
from the sidebar menu.

Click _Manage Users_ and then click the hamburger menu next to the user you want to use for the API access. Select
_Generate/Revoke API Tokens_.

Give your token a name and generate it. Take note of the _Key_ and _ID_ values in the modal window.

### Configuring the BloodHound API in Ghostwriter

Take the _ID_ and _Token_ values and plug them into the BloodHound API Configuration in Ghostwriter. You will also need
to add the URL of your BloodHound instance. The URL should be the base URL of your BloodHound instance, including the
protocol and port (if needed). For example, `http://bloodhound:8080`.

#### Testing the Configuration

Once you have configured the BloodHound API in Ghostwriter, an admin can test the configuration by clicking the _Test BloodHound_
button on the _Review Configuration_ page. This will send a request to the `/api/version` endpoint of the BloodHound API
and verify that the connection is successful.

#### Per-Project Instances

If you have multiple BloodHound instances — such as seperate servers for different clients — you can configure a BloodHound server for a project.
Project members can manage their BloodHound instance under the _BloodHound_ tab on the project dashboard.
