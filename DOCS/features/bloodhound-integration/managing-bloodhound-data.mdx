An overview of the BloodHound data is available under your Project dashboard. If you have a global server or project server configured,
you will see the _BloodHound_ tab on the dashboard. This tab will show you the configured server's URL and has buttons for testing the
connection and fetching the latest data.

Once Ghostwriter has data, you will see one or more expandable sections. The _Domains_ section shows an overview of the collected domains
data. If the configured server is a BHE server, you will also see a _Findings_ section with an overview of the BHE findings.

## Managing the Data

Project members can refresh the BloodHound data at any time by clicking the _Fetch BloodHound Data_ button. That will kick-off the BloodHound
connection that retrieves the latest data from the configured server. This process can take a few minutes to complete. A toast notification
will appear to let you know the fetch was successful and instructing you to refresh the page to see the new data.
