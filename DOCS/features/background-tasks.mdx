description: Configuring and scheduling background tasks
---

Ghostwriter uses the [Django Q project](https://django-q.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for queuing and managing background tasks. Django Q hands off tasks to the Redis server (already installed and running in Docker).

Tasks are defined in the `tasks.py` file. These tasks can be executed on demand or on a schedule.

Tasks can be queued in a few different ways:

* Schedule tasks to execute in the future and on a recurring schedule with Django Q.

* Use the buttons (various) in Ghostwriter's web interface.

* Use a REST API endpoint (not yet available).
