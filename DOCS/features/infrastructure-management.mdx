Using Ghostwriter to manage and monitor servers and domain names

Ghostwriter helps you manage and monitor covert infrastructure, including servers and domain names. Tracking infrastructure in Ghostwriter creates a historical record of how and when your infrastructure was used.

Additionally, the infrastructure manager can be setup to monitor assets for changes in domain categorization and open ports/services exposed to the public internet.
