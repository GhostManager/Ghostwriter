Walk through of the project dashboard

The project dashboard is your go-to place for viewing everything about a specific project. It tracks all the essential information the assessment team needs to be effective.

The _Planning_ tab displays the basic information, like the assessment's duration, the teams' working hours (with time zone), and the project description.

This tab also has the project calendar. The calendar automatically tracks team assignments, the assessment's duration, objective due dates, and the reporting period:
