title: "Configuring Extra Fields"
---

Ghostwriter v4.1 introduces Extra Fields, additional user-defined fields that can be added to several objects that Ghostwriter stores for data specific to your own workflow.

### Configuring

To configure extra fields, go to Admin Panel > Admin Panel, and then "Extra Field Configurations". Then select the object type you wish to configure extra fields for.

Each extra field has the following options:

* Internal Name: Name used to store the field internally, as well as in templates. Cannot contain spaces, and must be unique across all fields for an object type.

* Display Name: Name that is used in the UI for the field. Spaces are allowed here.

* Type: The data type of the field. Currently this includes:

    * **Checkbox**: Single true/false checkbox

    * **Single Line of Text**: Single line of unformatted text

    * **Formatted Text**: Multiple lines of text with formatting

    * **Integer**: Whole integer value without any decimal component

    * **Number**: Numeric value, potentially with a decimal component

After saving the field, it will appear in the object's edit forms and in their detail pages:

### Using in Templates

In templates, an object's extra fields are stored as subattributes of the `extra_fields` attribute. For example, to display the field with the internal name `internal_contact` on a Client stored on the variable `client`, you can write `{{client.extra_fields.internal_contact}}`.

The extra field may be `None` internally if the extra field was created after the object was, and has not been set yet.
