## Introducing Global Configurations

An administrator can update global configuration at any time in the Django admin panel under the *Command Center* section. Visit */admin/commandcenter/* to view the current configuration on your server. Visit each configuration and personalize your settings.

<Info>
The Ghostwriter server does **not** need to be restarted for changes to take effect.
