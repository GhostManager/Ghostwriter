If enabled, Ghostwriter will use Slack to send notifications and reminders to configured channels. The configuration requires an incoming Webhook.

Specify a username and emoji for the bot. Emojis must be set using Slack syntax like (e.g., `:ghost:`). You can use any emoji available in your Slack team â€“ including custom emojis.

The username can be anything you could use for a Slack username. The emoji will appear as the bot's avatar alongside the username.

The alert target is the message target. You can set this to a blank string or a user, aliases, or @here/@channel. Slack username/alias targets must be written as `<!here>`, `<!channel>`, or `<@username>` for them to work as actual notification keywords.

Finally, set the target channel. This might be your `#general` or some other channel. This is the global value Ghostwriter will use for all messages unless a project-specific channel is supplied. When users create a new project, there is an option to provide a Slack channel for project-related notifications.
