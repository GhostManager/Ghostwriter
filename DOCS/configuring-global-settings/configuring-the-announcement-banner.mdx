Ghostwriter supports an announcement banner that admins can use to display important messages to users. This feature is
useful for notifying users about updates, maintenance, or other significant information.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/configuring-global-settings/image-15.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

The banner offers a configurable title, message, and link. You can also choose to display the banner only to authenticated
users or all visitors (i.e., display it even on the login page).

You can also set an expiration date for the banner. It will automatically disappear after the configured date and time.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/configuring-global-settings/image-16.png" alt=""/>
</Frame>

If a user clicks the "x" button to close the banner, it will not reappear for that user until the next time the banner changes.
This allows users to dismiss the banner so it doesn't appear every time they visit the site or a new page.
