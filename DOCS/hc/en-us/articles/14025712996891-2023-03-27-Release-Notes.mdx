### BloodHound Enterprise

### Improved Functionality

* Azure-based Entity Panels have undergone the same treatment as their AD-based counterparts. Azure entities should now load their panels significantly faster and queue up relationship-based results in the background to load when those counts become available.

### Bug Fixes

* Entity Panels will no longer hide keys based on their value. For example, "Enabled" should always appear, even if the value is "False".
* Resolved an issue where Inbound and Outbound Object Control options would show inconsistent results between a controlled and controlling object.
* Fixed an issue in Entity Panels for Groups where the Sessions tab would contain inaccurate results for Computers contained within the group.
