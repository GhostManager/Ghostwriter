## Announcements

### SharpHound v2 General Availability
After several months of testing, SharpHound v2 has reached General Availability! SharpHound v2 expands on the ability of BloodHound to provide accurate reporting of Attack Paths through the collection and processing of User Rights Assignment collected from customer endpoints. 

Thank you so much to all our customers who have worked with us to test and validate the capabilities offered.

### SharpHound v1 End-of-Life

With the release of SharpHound v2, we have marked SharpHound v1 download as deprecated within BloodHound Enterprise. We will leave the download available until the end of February; however, no more development will occur on this version. SharpHound v1 will officially be end-of-life on May 1, 2023.

**NOTE:** Upgrading to SharpHound v2+ must occur concurrently on all services and requires enabling the “Enable post processing of local groups” early access feature simultaneously.

Instructions to upgrade your collector may be found [here](/hc/en-us/articles/9295247077915)! Our Customer Success team will begin reaching out to all customers still running SharpHound v1 and would be happy to help if you require it.

### BloodHound Enterprise

* Improved Functionality
    * \[Requires SharpHound v2.1.0\] SharpHound now supports significantly more trust configurations to perform collections within your environment.
    * We've added a caching layer to the Entity Panel. This means repeated views of the same object within the environment will see significantly improved performance between views.
* Bug Fixes
    * Addressed several Entity Panel bugs that resulted in data never loading in the view. We have additional work ongoing on this portion of the product to improve performance and consistency.
    * Attack Path exposures should no longer calculate >100%.
    * Significant improvement to data ingest speeds; this should reduce the time your environment shows in "Ingesting" during collection.
    * Resolved a logic issue in the AzResetPassword edge that resulted in false positives.
    * The RemoteInteractiveLogonPrivilege edge will no longer appear in pathfinding queries.
    * Fixed specific issues which could result in data sent by SharpHound unexpectedly timing out.
    * Tier Zero views should consistently show all members of the group.
