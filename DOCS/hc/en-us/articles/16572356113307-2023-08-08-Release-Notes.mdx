* 👑 What is Tier Zero / Control Plane, and why does it matter?
* 🏢 What does the industry include in Tier Zero?
* 👩‍⚖️ Debate: Should they be?

Check out the recording of this information-rich conversation [here](https://specterops.zoom.us/rec/share/aV6SLGu93-hZ0ot9pSgh9-_PnuORkcidpdCAywPHcL8qqM58F3qeG7fuRjvXXXFd.iTsCCftUEGCjH92f)!

### BloodHound Enterprise

#### Improved Functionality

* **Open-ended Cypher search** \- Perhaps the most requested feature of BloodHound Enterprise since we launched is now live! BloodHound Enterprise now supports searches using the [openCypher](https://opencypher.org/) grammar, a query language designed for searching graph-based data. We've included several interesting queries to get you started and you can learn more about [Searching with Cypher](/hc/en-us/articles/16721164740251) in documentation.

* **Edge context menus** \- Clicking on an Attack Path will now show a contextual menu similar to clicking on an object within BloodHound Enterprise. The displayed menu will include properties about the selected relationship and more in-depth contextual information about the Attack Path itself.

* **Pathfinding enhancements** \- When pathfinding, you can now easily swap start and end objects, plus filter the Attack Path primitives used by the pathfinding algorithm to narrow your query to information of interest.

* **Offline collection ingest** \- BloodHound Enterprise now officially supports an easy upload and ingest mechanism for offline collections from [SharpHound CE](/hc/en-us/articles/17481151861019). Whether performing merger and acquisition due diligence or monitoring risk within disconnected networks (such as ICS environments). Uploading offline SharpHound collections is now just a few clicks away under the Administration section.

* **API Explorer improvements** \- The API explorer has undergone some updates to indicate which BloodHound products each endpoint applies to. We've also fixed the "Try it out" buttons to make it easier to see how data queries and responses will look.
