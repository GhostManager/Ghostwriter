### SharpHound Upgrades Required

SharpHound v2 is officially generally available. If you have not already done so, please make sure you upgrade your SharpHound collectors to v2.1+. SharpHound v1 will officially be end-of-life on May 1, 2023.

**NOTE:** Upgrading to SharpHound v2+ must occur concurrently on all services and requires enabling the “Enable post processing of local groups” early access feature simultaneously.

### BloodHound Enterprise

* Improved Functionality
    * Entity Panels for AD objects have undergone restructuring and should load significantly faster now! Previously, each panel would load all data elements at once; this meant that a big query like "Outbound Control" could take a long time and prevent you from seeing data. These now load separately and will allow you to view available data faster - _way faster._ Note, very large / complex environments may still hit constraints pulling information back from specific queries within the panel but this will no longer prevent the rest of the panel from loading.  Future work is planned in this area to provide partial results where applicable. 
    * Explore node searches will also return much faster due to query optimizations and post-processing improvements. 
        _Note: Azure Entity Panels are undergoing the same improvements and will be available soon!_
* Bug Fixes
    * Cleaned up logging in AzureHound related to stalled data collection jobs
    * Cleaned up where API responses included skip, limit, and count where they were not in use
