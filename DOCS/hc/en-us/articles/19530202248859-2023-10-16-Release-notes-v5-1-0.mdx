### SharpHound (v2.2.1 - BHE Only)


#### New and Improved Features

* **LDAPS support** \- SharpHound Enterprise will now attempt to utilize LDAPS by default on port 636/TCP before falling back to signed and sealed LDAP. Customers may enforce LDAPS through the "ForceLDAPSSL" option in settings.json. See [SharpHound Enterprise Local Configuration](/hc/en-us/articles/9268639353115) for more.
* **Caching enhancements** \- SharpHound has improved caching performance and will automatically invalidate local cache data on newer versions and every 30 days to ensure improved data accuracy while maintaining collection improvements offered by the cache.
* **Collection speed improvements** \- Optimized LDAP queries will enable significant collection performance improvements. These improvements will be most notable during local group and session enumeration in large environments.
* **Modern LAPS support** \- Added support for modern LAPS for the haslaps property on computer objects.
* **Port scan timeout configuration** \- Added support for configuring the port scan timeout utilized for privileged collection on domain-joined systems (defaults to 500ms).
* **Concurrent thread configuration** \- Added support for configuring the number of concurrent consumer threads active in SharpHound (defaults to 50). Consumer threads process data from the main LDAP queries to perform data enrichment or connect to domain-joined systems for performing privileged collections.

#### Bug Fixes

* Enterprise Domain Controller group membership will now reconcile properly.

### AzureHound (v2.1.3)

#### Bug Fixes

* Resolved multiple dead-lock resource-exhaustion condition edge cases during collection.
