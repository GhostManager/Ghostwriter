### SharpHound Hardening Guidelines

We commonly receive questions about how to properly secure the server and service account utilized for SharpHound, particularly in environments that opt for privileged collection support. As a result, our team has researched, tested, and published recommendations on configuring the SharpHound server and service account to mitigate the most common risks to the configuration. You can find those recommendations in our documentation [here](/hc/en-us/articles/12400091052955).
