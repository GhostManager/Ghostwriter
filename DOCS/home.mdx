Ghostwriter is a part of your team. It helps you manage clients, projects, reports, and infrastructure in one application. It does not replace some of the more common or traditional project management tools, such as CRMs. Still, it consolidates all relevant project information so users can easily curate every aspect of their projects.

This site will always have the most up-to-date documentation on how to install and use Ghostwriter. To learn more about Ghostwriter, check out this [article](https://posts.specterops.io/introducing-ghostwriter-part-1-61e7bd014aff)


Ghostwriter is entirely free and open-source (FOSS) software. All of the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter).
